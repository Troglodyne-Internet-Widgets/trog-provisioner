=head2 SYNOPSIS

    somedomain:
        nginx:
            backlog: 32768

=head2 DESCRIPTION

Install nginx, set the kernel backlog and worker_connections to C<backlog>, and
install the global configuration of nginx.

With C<syslog>, the default, nginx also sends its access log and its error log
to the syslog of the guest, tagged C<nginx_access> and C<nginx_error>.  So
L<Provisioner::Recipe::logshipper> forwards them.  The files stay, because the
jails of fail2ban read them.  A server block that names its own C<access_log>
replaces the one sent to syslog, so the mirrors of C<aptmirror> and
C<fetchcache> do not send their traffic there.

=head2 USE AS DEPENDENCY

Use this recipe as a dependency of other nginx recipes, not on its own.

sub rate_limits {

    # One page load opens dozens of connections to one origin, and a shared NAT
    # multiplies that by each user behind it.  A thousand a second is not a visitor.
    return ( 80 => 1024, 443 => 1024 );
}

=head2 %jails = $recipe->jails()

The jails that fail2ban ships for nginx: failed basic authentication, and
requests for the paths that bots probe.  Both read the error log of nginx, so
both read the file and not the journal.

    return (
        'nginx-http-auth' => { backend => 'auto' },

}

=head2 @names = $recipe->subdomains()

C<www>, which the vhost this writes answers for: it serves the domain and every
alias, and www is an alias rather than a name of its own.
